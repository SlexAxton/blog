I have been pretty neglectful of my blog since I started at Bazaarvoice, but I think I'm going to try to pick up a little bit. That being said, here's a short update.

I am now a featured author on <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/scriptjunkie">ScriptJunkie</a> - a new website from Microsoft about front end development. Check out my post <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/scriptjunkie/ff728622.aspx">"Building and Maintaining Large JavaScript Applications"</a>

I'll likely cover a few more topics concerning large application structure in the future, both on my blog and on yayQuery and ScriptJunkie.

Also, TXJS happened. I'd suggest going to the <a href="http://texasjavascript.com/">totally awesome webpage</a> and catching the slides and the speakerrate pages for all the talks to get caught up on how much awesomeness happened. Also, my fridge is still full of left over beer, so if you're in town... beer.js at my place.
