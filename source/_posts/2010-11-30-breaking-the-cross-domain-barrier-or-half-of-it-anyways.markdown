I gave a talk at TXJS and AustinJS about cross domain communication in JavaScript. Here is a video that stopped halfway through that talk.

Sorry for the half-vid, and low quality, but I figured it was worth putting out there, as I've had a few requests for it and I'm running out of hard drive space. Perhaps with any pressure, I'd do a screencast.

Also, this was the day that I took two green nyquil pills thinking that GREEN meant DAY (for dayquill). So I may be a little more relaxed than normal. I'm sure the beer didn't help either. I rather liked it, if I recall.
