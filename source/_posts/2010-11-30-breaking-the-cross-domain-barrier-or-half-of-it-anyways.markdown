I gave a talk at TXJS and AustinJS about cross domain communication in JavaScript. Here is a video that stopped halfway through that talk.

The slides are available here: [Breaking The Cross Domain Barrier](http://www.slideshare.net/SlexAxton/breaking-the-cross-domain-barrier)

Sorry for the half-vid, and low quality, but I figured it was worth putting out there, as I've had a few requests for it and I'm running out of hard drive space. Perhaps with any pressure, I'd do a screencast.

Also, this was the day that I took two green nyquil pills thinking that GREEN meant DAY (for dayquill). So I may be a little more relaxed than normal. I'm sure the beer didn't help either. I rather liked it, if I recall.
