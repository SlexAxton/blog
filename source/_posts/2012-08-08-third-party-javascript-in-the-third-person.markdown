At the end of last year I spoke at the awesome [CapitolJS](http://capitoljs.com/) Conference in DC. I was encouraged to talk a little more broadly about third-party JavaScript development and its various quirks. When I got back home to [AustinJS](http://austinjavascript.com/) we had some time for a short talk. Luckily, [Logan Lindquist](https://twitter.com/llbbl) is usually there to film talks for [Austin Tech Videos](http://www.austintechvideos.com/). Long story short, my talk and slides are now available for *Third Party JavaScript in the Third Person*.

The slides are available (likely in webkit) at: [alexsexton.com/talks/thirdparty](https://alexsexton.com/talks/thirdparty)

I can't thank Logan enough for doing [Austin Tech Videos](http://www.austintechvideos.com/). It's a treasure trove of all kinds of talks from around town.
