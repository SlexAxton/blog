I thought I would make a quick post for anyone coming here for my slides from Developer-Day here in Austin.

[Superclassy Inheritance in JavaScript Slides](http://www.slideshare.net/SlexAxton/superclassy-inheritance-in-javascript)

----

I plan on giving a screencast of sorts a try, and perhaps even breaking up some of the sections into a few blog posts on the subject. Encapsulation, modularity and code reuse is an interesting topic in any language, but especially when it comes to applying those ideas to real life applications and web sites.

The demo pages can be found at [A Totally Realistic Demo Page for applying Inheritance in Javascript](https://alexsexton.com/inheritance/demo/) or whatever.

Thanks to Viget for having me out to speak today, it was a blast.
