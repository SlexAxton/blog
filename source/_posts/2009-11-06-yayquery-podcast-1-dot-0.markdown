A few of the ladies and fellas from the #jquery IRC ([Adam J. Sontag](http://ajpiano.com/), [Paul Irish](http://paulirish.com/), & [Rebecca Murphey](http://rmurphey.com/)) and I decided to make a podcast on the topic of jQuery. We landed on the name yayQuery!

From Paul's blog post:

We talk about...

* [Underscore.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/) - a great utility belt (very handy for Ruby/Python folks), comes with John Resig's microtemplating script and lots more
* Thickbox - [Rest in peace](http://jquery.com/demo/thickbox/). Also alternatives: [Colorbox](http://jacklmoore.com/colorbox/), [jQuery UI Dialog](http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/)
* jQuery on mobile. [Phonegap](http://phonegap.com/), [XUI](http://xuijs.com/), [jQTouch](http://www.jqtouch.com/), going it alone
* Anti-Pattern of the week: css(key,val)
* $var and Hungarian notation
* ... and dancing

I'd love to get your feedback on what you liked or didn't like. If people seem to enjoy it, we'd love to step up the production just a bit, but it doesn't really make sense quite yet.

You can also follow us on twitter ([@yayQuery](https://twitter.com/yayQuery))  if you want updates for the next episodes and such. Yay!
